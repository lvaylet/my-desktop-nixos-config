## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Multi-Target Device Provisioning & Profile Management (Priority: P1)

An operator needs to provision, bootstrap, and maintain multiple distinct machine profiles—including a high-performance interactive desktop workstation, a headless 24/7 home server, and a minimal bootable recovery medium—from a single source of truth without configuration drift.

**Why this priority**: Core foundational capability. Without multi-target profile definitions and automated provisioning, machines cannot be deployed or maintained consistently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating any target profile (desktop, homelab, or recovery media) independently and verifying that all target-specific services, hardware settings, and base capabilities are produced accurately according to its profile definition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new or wiped target machine, **When** booted into the recovery/installation environment, **Then** the system provides immediate network connectivity and a secure shell accessible via the operator's pre-authorized cryptographic keys.
2. **Given** a primary workstation profile request, **When** the system is generated, **Then** graphical desktop capabilities, hardware acceleration, sound subsystems, local developer tools, and user interaction utilities are configured.
3. **Given** a home server profile request, **When** the system is generated, **Then** headless background services, network filtering, media management, file sharing, and container support are enabled while graphical desktop packages are omitted.
4. **Given** global user identity settings (name, email, SSH authorization keys), **When** applied to any managed profile, **Then** user accounts and access credentials are created identically across all machines.

### User Story 2 - Safe Verification & Deployment of Configuration Changes (Priority: P1)

A system operator needs to modify system settings or user environment definitions, verify changes against automated quality and security checks, test activations non-destructively in temporary running state, and safely promote them to permanent system generations with immediate rollback capability.

**Why this priority**: Eliminates system downtime, prevents broken boot environments, and protects the operator against configuration errors and secret leaks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by introducing a configuration update, executing the verification suite to ensure all security/quality rules pass, testing activation in a live session without updating boot defaults, and subsequently switching generations to verify generation rollback availability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** pending configuration modifications, **When** the verification suite is run, **Then** code formatting, static correctness rules, unused definition checks, and secret exposure scanners evaluate with zero failures.
2. **Given** verified configuration updates, **When** tested in live mode, **Then** new configurations and services activate immediately for validation without changing the default bootloader generation.
3. **Given** a successfully tested configuration, **When** switched permanently, **Then** the new generation becomes the default boot environment, and a historical rollback generation is preserved in the bootloader.
4. **Given** an unbootable or faulty new generation, **When** rebooting the machine, **Then** the operator can select any previous generation from the boot menu to restore full functionality in under 60 seconds.

### User Story 3 - Unified Personal Developer Environment & Tooling (Priority: P2)

A developer working across multiple managed machines expects an identical, customized terminal environment, shell prompt, file navigation tools, text editing configurations, and version control preferences without manually syncing dotfiles.

**Why this priority**: Maximizes daily developer productivity and eliminates context switching and environment discrepancies between workstation and server environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging into any managed target and verifying that terminal prompts, shell aliases, text editing plugins, git configurations, and search utilities function identically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an interactive terminal session on any managed machine, **When** the operator opens a shell, **Then** custom prompt styling, history navigation, intelligent fuzzy searching, and aliases are immediately active.
2. **Given** a code editing session in terminal or graphical editors, **When** opening source files, **Then** syntax highlighting, code navigation, diagnostics, and auto-formatting are available out of the box.
3. **Given** version control workflows, **When** committing, diffing, rebasing, or resolving merge conflicts, **Then** author identity, conflict resolution tools, and custom git settings are pre-configured.

### User Story 4 - Home Infrastructure & Media Services (Priority: P3)

A home lab administrator wants their headless home server to reliably host background network infrastructure, network-wide ad-blocking DNS, media streaming catalogs, local web file browsing, home automation controllers, and isolated container applications.

**Why this priority**: Centralizes home entertainment and network utilities onto dedicated, always-on infrastructure with minimal administrative overhead.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying the homelab profile and verifying that media indexing, DNS filtering, web file management, and container runtimes start automatically and respond to authorized local network traffic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active home server instance, **When** the system starts up, **Then** DNS filtering, media streaming, file management, home automation, and download services initialize automatically in the background.
2. **Given** network traffic directed at managed service endpoints, **When** accessing declared services, **Then** the system firewall permits authorized service traffic while blocking unexposed ports.
3. **Given** containerized application workloads, **When** deployed on the host, **Then** the container runtime executes them rootlessly or in isolation with standard orchestration tools.

### User Story 5 - System Housekeeping & Storage Reclamation (Priority: P4)

A system maintainer needs to periodically optimize local storage, purge outdated generations, clean unreferenced package caches, and update upstream dependencies deterministically.

**Why this priority**: Prevents disk exhaustion over long operating periods and ensures system software receives security and functional updates reliably.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running generation cleanup and dependency update commands and confirming disk space recovery and deterministic dependency lock file updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** accumulated historical system generations on disk, **When** running a cleanup operation with a retention policy, **Then** generations older than the retention threshold and unreferenced cached files are purged.
2. **Given** upstream component updates, **When** performing a dependency upgrade, **Then** all upstream inputs are resolved and locked deterministically for reproducible builds.

### Edge Cases

- **Network Disconnection During System Verification**: The system verification and build processes must succeed offline when using previously fetched dependencies.
- **Faulty Hardware or Kernel Incompatibility**: If a newly built kernel or driver fails to boot, the bootloader menu retains previous working generations with no data loss.
- **Accidental Secret Exposure**: If an unencrypted secret or private key is staged for commit, automated pre-commit scanners must block the action and report the offending file.
- **Service Startup Failure in Server Profile**: If a background home service crashes or fails on boot, the service manager must restart the service and isolate the failure without bringing down the host OS.
- **Disk Storage Exhaustion**: When storage capacity reaches critical thresholds, manual or scheduled garbage collection routines can reclaim unreferenced data without disrupting active profile files.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Key Entities

- **Machine Profile**: A declarative specification of a target machine defining hardware integration, base OS configuration, system services, and user environment allocations (e.g., Desktop Workstation, Homelab Server, Rescue ISO).
- **User Identity & Environment**: A centralized record of the operator's persona (full name, username, email, SSH credentials) and customized user-space tooling (shell, prompt, editors, file managers, git settings).
- **System Generation**: An immutable, versioned snapshot of the operating system and user profile resulting from a build or switch operation, selectable in the bootloader.
- **Service Definition**: A background daemon or workload (e.g., DNS sinkhole, media server, container runtime, SSH) specifying its lifecycle, configuration parameters, and firewall rules.
- **Unified Task Recipe**: A standardized command entrypoint that automates a discrete lifecycle or maintenance operation (e.g., build, test, switch, lint, format, check, clean).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Rescue/installation image boots to a network-connected, SSH-accessible prompt in under 2 minutes on target hardware.
